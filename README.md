#ScoreboardStats

ScoreboardStats is a [Bukkit](https://github.com/Bukkit/Bukkit) plugin
    that uses the sidebar from scoreboard feature which was introduced into
    [Minecraft](http://minecraft.net) since version
    [1.5](http://mcupdate.tumblr.com/post/45267771887/minecraft-1-5).
This plugin simplifies, adds many new features and possible ways to improve
    the use of it.

###Compatibility

This plugin is compatible with all Minecraft versions above 1.5, where the
    scoreboard feature was introduced by [Mojang](https://mojang.com/).

Based on vanilla servers (like Craftbukkit) doesn't allow individual and global
objectives at the same time. By operating over packets, we can workaround this.
For this method, you'll need ProtocolLib. It's used to prevent conflicts with
other plugins which also access the sidebar objective. Otherwise the client
could crash.

These plugins are (tested) compatible (just activate comaptibilityMode):
* HealthBar (http://dev.bukkit.org/bukkit-plugins/health-bar/)
* ColoredTags (http://dev.bukkit.org/bukkit-plugins/colored-tags/)
* GhostPlayer (http://dev.bukkit.org/bukkit-plugins/ghost-player/)
* McCombatLevel (http://dev.bukkit.org/bukkit-plugins/mccombatlevel/)
